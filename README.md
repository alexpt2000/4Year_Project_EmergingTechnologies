A simple web application that recognizes handwritten digits. 

Developed using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and the super simple [Keras](http://keras.io/) Library. 

Wrapped into a Webapp using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) Micro Framework.

Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is a type of ANN inspired by the organization of animals' visual cortex. It is used in most of the image recognition tasks.

This model was trained using the MNIST Handwritten digits dataset. 

To run it locally, first clone the directory. 

```git clone https://github.com/alexpt2000gmit/4Year_Project_EmergingTechnologies``` 

Next cd into the directory.

```cd 4Year_Project_EmergingTechnologies```

Then install the dependencies using pip.

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

To start the Flask Server,

```python app.py```
